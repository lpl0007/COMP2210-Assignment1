# COMP 2210: Assignment 1

This assignment focuses on implementing the methods of a class much like java.util.Arrays. The Selector.java file defines a class with static methods designed to provide useful functionality on arrays, with the common theme of selecting values in an array with particular properties. Each method of Selector is clearly specified, is independent of the other methods in the class, and is designed to provide relatively simple functionality. So, this is a great context in which to practice systematic, disciplined development and test-based verification.

- The Selector.java source code file is provided in the startercode folder in Vocareum. You can download Selector.java from Vocareum and work on your local machine.

- The comments provided in Selector.java describe the required behavior of each method.

- The constructor of the Selector class has been written for you and it must not be changed in any way.

- You may add any number of private methods that you like, but you may not add any public method or constructor, nor may you change the signature of any public method or constructor.

- You must not add any fields, either public or private, to the Selector class.

- The java.util.Arrays class has been imported for you. You are free to delete this import statement if you do not use any methods from the Arrays class in your solutions.

- You may not add any other import statement, and you may not use another resource from the java.util package. The penalty for violating this constraint will be a deduction of points up to 50% of the total points available on the assignment.

- You may not use sorting in any method, except for kmin and kmax. The penalty for violating this constraint will be a deduction of points up to 50% of the total points available on the assignment.

- You do not have to use sorting in kmin and kmax, but doing so makes the solution more straightforward. If you choose to use sorting in these two methods, I suggest that you use the sort(int[]) method from the java.util.Arrays class.
